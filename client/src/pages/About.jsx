                If you&#8217;ve found your way to NewlyNet, chances are
                you&#8217;re a new studentâ€”just like I once was. I&#8217;m Ryan,
                the founder of this site, and I know firsthand how overwhelming
                it can be to step into a new school where everything and
                everyone is unfamiliar.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p className="text-left">
                Before creating NewlyNet, I was the new kid at Princeton High
                School. The thought of making friends and finding my place felt
                daunting, and I worried high school would be a tough ride.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p className="text-left">
                That&#8217;s exactly why I started NewlyNet. It&#8217;s a place
                where new students like you can connect with other new students
                or existing students, whether through club servers, school
                servers, or group chats. Here, you&#8217;ll find others who are
                in a similar situation as you, getting ready to start fresh at a
                new school.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p className="text-left">
                I hope that after using NewlyNet, you&#8217;ll feel more at ease
                and excited about your high school journey. Remember, school is
                meant to be a place where you thrive, not just survive.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p className="text-left">
                Best of luck,
                <br />
